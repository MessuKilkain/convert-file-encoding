# Convert File Encoding

Convert File Encoding package for saving files in a different encoding.

## TODOs
* Restore scroll position after conversion
* Add more encoding conversion options (ideally based on [encoding-selector package](https://github.com/atom/encoding-selector))
* Display warning confirmation message when encoding conversion is a destructive operation
* Add unit tests

## Notes

I'm not entirely sure the conversion works well on big files.
